# 七子棋
* 规则简单的三人游戏.一般来说每次下两子.最先下的人第一次下一子,最后下的人第一次下三子.
* 右键单击使用机器人下一子.(随便写的机器人,比较呆,见谅.)
* 依赖wxPython实现图形界面.
* GUI\游戏逻辑\机器人,三者分离.方便单独编写模块替换.

# Connect7 (seven-in-a-row)

* A three player game with simple rules. Generally speaking, two pieces are played in each round. The first player plays one piece in the first round, and the last player plays three pieces in the first round.

* Right click to use the robot to move to the next chess piece (Robots are something I casually wrote, it's quite silly. I apologize.).

* Relying on wxPython to implement a graphical interface.

* GUI, game logic, and robots are separated, making it convenient to write separate modules for replacement.
